                        <p>Dear Student,</p>

                        <p>We sincerely apologize for the academic alert email that you recently received from the
                            Academic Monitoring & Mentorship System.</p>

                        <p>The email was generated during the testing phase of our final-year academic project. While
                            validating the system functionality, we assumed the email IDs used in the database were
                            non-functional sample entries. However, some of those addresses were active, and as a result
                            the notification was unintentionally delivered to you.</p>

                        <p><strong>Please be assured that:</strong></p>
                        <ul style="color:#475569;">
                            <li>The email was part of a system testing activity</li>
                            <li>It does NOT reflect your actual attendance or academic performance</li>
                            <li>No disciplinary action, record entry, or academic consequence is associated with it</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We deeply regret any confusion or concern this may have caused.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation while we complete the development of this
                            academic project.</p>
